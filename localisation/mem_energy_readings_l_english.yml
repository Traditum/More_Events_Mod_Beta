 mem_energy_readings_category_desc:0 "There is an object in orbit around [From.GetPlanetName] that is radiating something beyond the electromagnetic spectrum. The emissions are not a threat, though they are interfering with [Root.GetName]’s sensors somewhat."

 mem_energy_readings.11.desc:0 "On closer inspection, the source of the emissions is a large circular tube, roughly 27 kilometers in circumference, partially encased in a small asteroid. Rather than iron or chondrite, the majority of this asteroid is comprised of terrestrial soil. The tube is most likely an archaic particle accelerator, though how it got out into the middle of this star system is anyone’s guess. It is of little note beyond its unusual location, as the design is decades if not centuries behind our own advances."

 mem_energy_readings.10.desc:0 "The object is a small vehicle, featuring a partially exposed canopy clearly unfit for interplanetary space. Mounted in the forward compartment is what remains of a pair of bodies, melted as if by plasma until they resembled nothing more than a protoplasmic mass of organic compounds. Mounted to the rear of the craft is an advanced tachyon reactor, or what is left of one. Most of the device has been fused by the same high temperature discharge.\n\n Judging by the presence of tachyons and its unusual design, it is Science Officer [scientistname]’s opinion that this machine was capable of a crude form of time travel. There is no clear mechanism for this beyond the reactor, but there are several points on the superstructure where it looks like something has been torn away. What the machine was not capable of, however, was space travel. Planets move kilometres per second, star systems and galaxies faster still. This relative motion was not factored into the calculations of these brave pioneers, along with some other important details about shielding."

 mem_energy_readings.12.desc:0 "The object orbiting [From.GetPlanetName] is...strange. It does not conform to traditional notions of geometry, nor does it reflect light in a consistent manner. Traditional examination of its constituent materials has proved impossible, as our probes simply phase right through the anomaly. We can measure its size at least, by determining where the object is not. Science Officer [scientistname]’s best guess is that it exists in several more dimensions than we can currently detect. It should be of interest to our physics team for years to come. \n\n Floating nearby is a small station, little more than a room with a window pointed directly at the object. The window contains a holographic interface, displaying segments of text in over a dozen written languages. Each section is succeeded by a set of dots. No fewer than one, no more than seven. The final section contained a summary of our analysis, written in our own text. Where the section ended, three dots appeared at the bottom."
